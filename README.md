Title: BMI calculator
We are going to make an app that can calcuate the BMI（a value derived from the mass and height of a person）of a person. 
The reason why it is important and we are interesting is we are interested about what a healthy body should look like. We want to know how to calculate the BMI for a person, and the range of BMI for a healthy person.
We are planning use C++ for our project.
The input of our program is the gender, height and weight for a person, and it will output the BMI for this person.
